Some question that can be asked in an interview

### 1) Array Index & Element Equality 

#### Description: 

Given a sorted arr of distinct integers, write a functional `indexEqualsValueSearch()`
that returns the lowest index i for which `arr[i] === i`. Return `-1` if there is no such index. Analyze the time and space complexities of your solution and explain its correctness

```Example:
arr = [-8, 0, 2, 5]
output = 2
arr = [-1, 0, 3, 6]
output = -1
```

### 2) Count the number of divisors of a positive integer

#### Description: 

We have to count the number of divisors of a positive integer, integer can go up to n = 500000. Provide most optimal method possible 

```Example:
4 --> 3 (1, 2, 4)
5 --> 2 (1, 5)
12 --> 6 (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12)
30 --> 8 (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30)

```
